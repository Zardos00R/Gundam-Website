          The RX-78-2 Gundam is the titular mobile suit of Mobile Suit Gundam
          television series. Part of the RX-78 Gundam series, it was built in
          secret on Side 7. The Gundam would turn the tide of war in favor of
          the Earth Federation during the One Year War against the Principality
          of Zeon. It was primarily piloted by Amuro Ray.

          The Gundam was incredibly advanced for its time. Built from
          lightweight Luna Titanium Alloy, its frame was both lighter than that
          of Zeon's mass-produced mobile suits and much sturdier, able to shrug
          off a MS-06 Zaku II's machine gun fire with little to no damage. Its
          offensive power was above and beyond that of the Zakus. The Gundam
          would engage in most battles with its beam rifle, making it the first
          mobile suit to have firepower equivalent to a battleship's beam
          cannons. In addition, it made use of two beam sabers, blades of
          extremely hot plasma which could cut through any metal with ease.
          Those beam sabers could be extended into a spear-like beam javelin,
          which could be used to stab into an enemy from a longer distance.

        <p class="gundam-combat">
          The Gundam also used more conventional weaponry; it could launch
          rockets with a "Hyper Bazooka", the Federation's answer to the
          bazookas used by Zeon's Zakus; in addition, its head was outfitted
          with a pair of small vulcan guns, as a way of attacking light-armored
          aircraft and vehicles without wasting ammo or energy from its more
          powerful armaments. It also made use of a very unconventional
          close-range weapon known as the "Gundam Hammer" - a large weapon
          similar to a flail which could be swung at enemies to deal crushing
          damage. The Gundam Hammer was eventually upgraded for use in space and
          outfitted with a number of verniers on the ball, and renamed to be the
          "Hyper Hammer". Lastly, it wielded a shield which would offer it a
          defense against enemy attacks that not even its Luna Titanium body
          could withstand without damage. Gundam pilot, Amuro Ray, would make
          use of the shield as a decoy in many battles, taking advantage of its
          size to fool the enemy into thinking he was charging at them, then
          attacking the enemy through the shield.

          Amuro Ray (アムロ・レイ Amuro Rei?) is the main protagonist of Mobile
          Suit Gundam, a supporting character in the sequel Mobile Suit Zeta
          Gundam, and the protagonist of Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's
          Counterattack. A Newtype, he is most famous for piloting the powerful
          RX-78-2 Gundam during the One Year War. Amuro was born on November 4,
          U.C. 0063 to Tem Ray and Kamaria Ray [3]. Though he was born on Earth,
          sometime as a small child his father took him to live in space to work
          on colony and weapon development, leaving behind his mother on Earth.
          Amuro never saw his mother again until the One Year War, and it is
          suggested that she did not write or contact him otherwise, though
          Amuro maintained his affection for her. Amuro befriended Fraw Bow
          sometime prior to 0079.
